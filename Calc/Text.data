You will receive one of our highest commendations for your effort.  It is ashame that you were unable to save all of thechildren but we understand the difficulty of thetask you undertook. You have saved humanity.\258*****Message from High Admiral (You kind of lose)Message from High Commander of United Planets:We understand that you were unable to save any ofthe children. We find it difficult to understand howyou were able to escape yet were unable to helpanyone else.  Please prepare a report on this matterand present it too me personally.  You have saved humanity, but were you more interested in saving yourself?\259*****Message from High Admiral (You kind of lose)Message from High Commander of United Planets:We understand that you were able to save all of the childrenbut neglected to destroy the monstrous scourge that hasinfected 5-DELTA-5.  We believe that these creatures arecapable of space travel and should begin swarming long before we are able to dispatch appropriate force.  Perhapsit would have been kinder to have left the children on theplanet.\260*****Message from High Admiral (You lose)Message from High Commander of United Planets:We understand that you were able to save some of the childrenbut neglected to destroy the monstrous scourge that hasinfected 5-DELTA-5.  Perhaps it is just as well that you did not save all of them. We believe that these creatures arecapable of space travel and should begin swarming long before we are able to dispatch appropriate force.  Yes, theymay have been the lucky ones.\261*****Message from High Admiral (You lose)Message from High Commander of United Planets:We understand that you were unable to save any of the childrenand even neglected to destroy the monstrous scourge that hasinfected 5-DELTA-5.
