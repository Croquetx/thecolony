WE HAVE BEENREQUESTED TO SEND ASSISTANCE TOCOLONY 5-DELTA-5 AT BEST POSSIBLESPEED.  YOU ARE ORDERED TO PROCEEDTO THE COLONY, ASSESS THE SITUATION,AND TO RENDER AID IF NECESSARY.REINFORCEMENTS WILL BE DELAYED.GOOD LUCK. MESSAGE COMPLETE.\115-DELTA-5 is a scientific researchcolony.  Their work is highlyclassified.  The planet where thecolony is based is standard Earthsize with little or no atmosphere.As a result the colony is actuallybuilt underground for protectionand to take advantage of the naturalrock formations.  There is sufficientwater to make it self-sufficient.Terraforming is scheduled to reachgamma stage in eighteen years.\12Please enter clearance code to Activate/Deactivate the reactorcore.  Core will descend inprotective casing.\13CYBERNETIC POWER SPACE SUIT INSTALLERSuit is auto-fitted to body type.Please select Armor and Weaponstrengths.NOTE: More powerful settings require additional energy supplied throughenergy matrix absorption.\14AIRLOCK SECURITYEnter security code toenable airlock system.\15DAMAGE REPORT:Central computer facilities havebeen destroyed.  Essential lifesupport and ship control systemsremain intact. Reactor Core has beendrained while escaping from blackhole.  It needs to be replaced.Insufficient fuel for anything otherthan life support.\165-DELTA-5 Emergency Broadcast System--------------------------------------IMPORTANT MESSAGE!Please report to the main conferenceroom on Level 1.  All children havebeen prepared for cryogenics.  Ourfinal options need to be discussed.\17Message from Lynne Butler:I am the last person alive on5-delta-5.  I do not have much time,I hear a creature approaching.  Thechildren have been cryogenicallyfrozen and hidden.  Thank God thecreatures don't seem to recognizethem as being alive.  The creaturesseem to attack by absorbing our lifeenergy.  We were unarmed, of course,and there was little that we could do.BEWARE OF THE QUEENS.\18To: Dr. David GrantFrom: Colonel Randall RadmerSubject: Computer FailuresDave,These computer malfunctions are reallygetting to be a pain in the butt.What is going on here?  I can't seemto get any of my messages across toanyone, and the files I need from themain computer appear to have beeneither erased or moved.  Now I knowthat you guys down in technical are alittle busy examining your "visitor",but I've got to get some work done.\19To: All Righteous MenFrom: Quartermaster Charles Little The evil men have brought the wrath ofGod upon us.  They have tampered withHis Realm and now we shall all haveHis Wrath visited unto us.  I triedto warn them but they would notlisten.  Now the Hell Creatures willclose the unholy gate and destroyus all.  This is as it should be.\20Security Log:First Lieutenant J. Strang reporting.We have stopped the creaturestemporarily on Level 2.  This shouldgive us enough time to prepare foranother assault.  They are incrediblypowerful, but they seem to weaken asthey get farther away from the PrimeQueen. Perhaps we can hold out untilthe U.P. Marines arrive. I havepersonally hidden one of the childrennearby.  If nothing else, perhapsthey will survive.\21Available Cross References:------------------------------------14256Fourth Dimensional Energy ConstructsBalkcom16345Existence in the Fourth DimensionBerfield, S.22411Fourth Dimension - Database (sw)Acius25486The Fourth Dimension - A Reality?Sills, P.33455The Fourth Dimension and N-SpaceSprenger43267Teleportation Through the4th Dimension Schneider,S.67887The Large Scale Structure of Space-TimeHawking, S.68699Global Structures of Space-TimeGeroch, R.77634Quantum Gravity, An OverviewSen, A.\22GENERAL RELATIVITY,Hawking, S.,Israel, W.  pg. 13--------------------------------------Although the spatially homogeneous andisotropic Friedmann models were verysuccessful in describing the large-scale structure of the universe, theyobviously do not reflect the localirregularities, such as stars andgalaxies.  To study these, one wantsto study deviations from the Friedmannmodel.  This was first done byLifshitz in 1946 using a linearapproximation.  He found thatsmall density enhancements...\23THE MANY-WORLDS INTERPRETATION OFQUANTUM MECHANICS                PrefaceIn 1957, in his Princeton doctoraldissertation, Hugh Everett, IIIproposed a new interpretation ofquantum mechanics that denies theexistence of a separate classicalrealm and asserts that it makes senseto talk about a state vector for thewhole universe.  This state vectornever collapses, and, hence, realityas a whole is rigorouslydeterministic.  This reality, which isdescribed jointly by the dynamicalvariables and the state vector, is notthe reality we customarily think of,but is a reality composed of manyworlds.  By virtue of the temporal ...\244D Physics     A. Sen--------------------------------------So it is shown that such analternative reality is not onlypossible, but perhaps even reachablefrom our own universe.  I will refrainfrom comment on the ramifications ofthis possibility.  I am sure thatthey are obvious to the reader.\25Alternative Life Forms in the UniverseV. Wisniewski--------------------------------------When non-earth based life is finallyfound in our universe we should beprepared for the possibility that itmay not be based upon carbon andwater.  Computer simulations haveshown that stable regenerating systemscan exist based upon more exoticmaterials.  In fact it has beenproposed that a pure energyreplicating system may be possible.This, of course, is merely inthe realm of speculation, hardly tobe taken seriously...\26Additional Information OnEnergy Absorption:This hypothesis presented by PeterSills (1997) was later shown to havea very low likelihood by ProfessorCary Northbrook.  Thus, furtherinvestigation of the subject fellout of favor and research funds driedup. For more information see:DARPA GRANTS CATALOGUE: 1990-2019.(Declassified).\27MEMO TO: Colonel Randall Radmer,Colony AdministratorFROM: Captain James EdwardsI was able to place the cryogenicchamber in an area in my apartmentbefore it was necessary for us tovacate.  I am certain Eric will besafe there.  Note that the creatureshave overrun the lower apartment leveland should reach the upper sometimethis afternoon.  This may be my last report for some time.\28MEMO TO:  Captain James Edwards,Acting Colony AdministratorFROM: E. Amiran,Senior Operation CoordinatorJust in case the situation takes aturn for the worse, I have instructeda technician to change the access codeto the main reactor core.  The codesequence is tied to Radmer's decoderwhich I assume is now in yourpossession.  In case of an extremeemergency, we may need to shut thepower down (or perhaps implode thereactor) rather quickly.Memorize the decoder value!\29MEMO: TO ALL PERSONNELFROM: Captain W. Nett,Adjutant Commander of Colony 5-DELTA-5This hysteria must stop!  I will nothave any more people coming into myoffice with fears about thesecreatures.  The scientists have themwell under control and I am not goingto begin expensive evacuationprocedures just because of theACCIDENTAL death of a technician.I have been reassured many times byProfessor Schneider on this matter.Let us now concentrate on the problemof how the teleporter failed in thefirst place and what we may learnof these creatures.\30Log of Richard Lee, M.D.The children have all been preparedfor cryogenic sleep.  I pray thatthis is a sleep from which they willone day awaken.They are being movedto the various locations in thecolony now.  I understand that Jeswill be placed on level four,perhaps in the mazerium.  So manypeople have died or are wounded.I don't know how much longer I cango on.  It may end soon anyway.\31Journal of Professor B. Bohleke.Entry 4657I succeeded in destroying one of thecreatures!  Instead of trying toabsorb the energy of the creatures asthe other scientists have been doing(with no success), I attempted tooverload it by increasing the amountof energy input into its system.I believe this causes them to becomeunstable so they revert to their pureenergy form (or to eggs as we havebeen calling them). If we had a powerspacesuit, we would be able to usethese eggs as energy sources.\32Dora Strang, R.N.:I have just placed one of thechildren on Level 5.  I am toldthat the creatures cannot detect youwhen you are in cryogenic freeze.They were originally intended forseriously ill people so that theycould be transported to the hospitalon Cygnus 7.  They never thoughtthat everyone might need them.No one predicted this.Who could predict this?\33Personal Notes of Randall Radmer,Commander of Colony 5-DELTA-5:I have been playing with one of thetwins' toys.  It seems so strange tothink of them in deep freeze.  It isthe only hope that they have, that anyof us have.  If only I could haveknown the danger that these creaturesrepresented.  I pray that these thingscannot leave the planet in any way.I have made the decision not toimplode the reactor core in orderthat the children may yet be saved.God help us all...\34Lab notes: Professor M. BakerTeleportation of the creature resultedin the complete destruction ofteleporter number 5.  We are not in aposition to duplicate the experimentin the near future and obviously arein no position to return the creatureto where it came from.  So far itseems fairly harmless, perhaps inshock from its transfer.  We believethat it comes from a differentdimension than ours.  It is justtoo different... \35Lab notes: Professor A.M. SherryThe creature that we have teleportedhas destroyed lab 6.  K. Allen, atechnician in the lab, was killed.It seems to have recovered energy byabsorbing it from Allen.  His body wasfound to be stone cold within minutesafter his death.  The creature hasescaped the lab and no one seems toknow where it has gone.  I believethat it may be heading for thereactor.\36Lab notes: J.T. Kirk, PhD We do not yet know the meaning of theso-called eggs.  They are sources ofhigh energy that we have been able tomake use of, almost like batteries.They seem to be multiplying incrediblyfast.  I have seen at least five eggson Level 4.  I am told that there maybe even more creatures.  Consideringhow destructive they are.  I havewarned Colonel Radmer.\37Lab notes: S. Schneider, PhDThose fools want me to abandon myresearch because of some stupid error.We are so close now!  The teleportersin Security Lab A are prepared for thefirst attempt at teleporting a livesubject.  I must see this through tothe end. My greatest achievement isclose at hand.\38Lab notes: M. Kurtz, PhDOur best guess about the origin of thealiens is that they were somehowbrought into existence in ourdimension through our experiments withteleportation and folding space.Either they inhabited a paralleluniverse and our teleporters enabledthem to cross over, or they weresimply created by our multidimensionalexperimentation.  \39Note:Remember that the robotic lifter isscheduled for maintenance in the nexttwo weeks.  The hydraulics need to beadjusted and that brake light needs tobe replaced.\40Dear Eric,Did you look behind the waterfall in'gate?  I had a bad dream last nightabout the triangle monsters comingafter me.  I'm scared.  Do you havebad dreams about them too?From Asher\41Dear Mom and Dad,I'm writing this note to you becauseI couldn't find you anywhere.  Theteacher wants us to go with some mendown to Level 5.  You told me never togo down there.  I'm scared.  Theteacher told me it would be alright,that we'd be rescued.  I hope you areOK.Love, Rachel\42The Last Will and Testament ofNicholas Bindle.

Further, itis our opinion that humanity's futuremust be weighed against our own.  Thiscan only lead one to a single possibleconclusion.  The reactor must beoverloaded to blow up the planet.\45I have taken a drug that will soon putme out of the misery and pain I feel.My family is gone, most of the othersas well.  These creatures havedestroyed all that I have worked for,all that was important to me. \46 In the event the finder of this notefinds that the creatures have invadedthe surface of the planet inpreparation of swarming, you mustDESTROY THIS PLANET.

Until thisproblem is solved their commercialviability may be limited...\58 It seems that we have made a slightprogramming error in the lastteleportation experiment.

In factit is quite sluggish, perhaps from theshock of teleporting.  But at least itis a living creature, and it hassurvived.  This can only improve theprospects of someday teleportingourselves across the great voids ofspace.\63The creatures seem to be drawn toenergy sources. In fact, I believethat they actually absorb energydirectly from their surroundings.When they pass by the room lighting,you can actually see it dim.  When Iget near them, they seem to sense mypresence, and I get cold chills.  Arethey absorbing my energy as well?\64Moved the cryogenic chambersinto position today.

I have beentold that these rooms have beensomehow modified by the creatures, sobe careful.  I know that I will neversee my children again.  Please do whatyou can to rescue them and the others.  \100Diary-I spent the day moving the childrenin the cryogenic chambers with theforklift.  I returned it to thestorage area when I was done.  I don'tknow why I bothered.  It reallydoesn't matter where it is now.\101Diary-The teleporters are in place and setup for the big day tomorrow.  We arestarting with a short range test so wehad to move the teleporters with theforklift.  We are certain that theteleporters will work for just aboutany distance.\102Diary-The alien seems capable of somehowwarping space.  Perhaps it has notbeen completely teleported into ourdimension and what we see is some kindof 3D "shadow."   I noticed thatalthough they cannot go through walls,they do move partially through them.\103Diary-The reactor core was readjusted today.The energy flux should be consistentnow.  Scott used the forklift to moveit.  He is getting quite good at itnow.\110------------------The Colonyby David A.

Yes,the children may have been the luckyones.  But you are not so lucky.  Wewill be looking forward to yourreturn...\262This is the report on the teleporterdisaster.  We are now sure that allof the creatures except the soldiersand drones lay eggs.  Only the Queenis capable of laying all varieties ofeggs.  When we cause the creatures tohave an energy overload, they revertto this "egg" form, but technicallythey are coalescing into their pureenergy state.  It is thentheoretically possible for us toabsorb that stored energy, therebydestroying the creatureand using the energy for our ownadvantage.   Next slide...\263Eye Spy.  This variety seems to be a"jack-of-all-trades."  It is a spy anda fighter, and when you are underattack from it, your weapons, armor,and life force all are drained.    Next slide... \264Pyramid and Diamond.  These varietiesattack your weapons system and yourlife force, respectively.   Next slide...\265Inverted Pyramid and Egg.  Thisvariety directs its energy towardreducing your defense system, orarmor.  When any creature ispositioned over an egg, it seems to bealmost invulnerable.   Next slide...\266Drone.  This variety is a fighter, butis not as powerful as the Soldier.It cannot reproduce.   Next slide...\267Soldier.  This is the generic fighter.Its attack causes all your systemsto be depleted.  It cannot reproduce.   Next slide...\268Snooper.  This is a sly one.  If itcrosses your trail, it picks up your"scent"  and follows you until itfinds you.  Its slimy attack doesn'tkill you, but does drain half of allyour power.   This creature seems tobe indestructible.  All of our weaponsseem to just bounce off of it with noaffect.   Next slide...\269Queen.  There is more than one Queen.We speculate that there also existsone Prime Queen.  The Queen is themost powerful of all, but we suspectthat terminating the Queen on anygiven level will cause all othercreatures on that level todisintegrate, or at least revert tothe egg phase.  Therefore, killing allQueens, or perhaps just the PrimeQueen, is the key to annihilating allof them.  There is no proof for thishypothesis as yet...       This is the last slide.\270This is a report on the final phaseof the teleporter project.  This isa top secret report and should beviewed only by those with properauthority.   Next slide...\271This is one of the working versionsof our teleporter.  You enter viathe sliding doors, and then closethe doors behind you.  You arethen transported to the teleporter which has been predetermined to benext in series.      Next slide...\272The doors on the teleporter appeardeceptively small.  There isactually a very high limit to themass you can enter with.  Vehiclesor heavy cargo are possible.   Next slide...\273This is the blueprint of theteleporter.  Once inside, the 3+dimensional quality of our designenables the walls to conform toalmost any topological form.    Next slide...\274This diagram illustrates the physicalprinciple behind teleportation.Without getting into technical detailsand examples, it is impossible todescribe the process, but it is notinaccurate to state that what occursis a "folding" of space.  Activatingthe teleporter causes a warp to forminstantaneously between your presentlocation and your destination, i.e. ashort-cut in space-time.      Next slide...\275In the previous phase of ourexperiment we transferred onlyinanimate objects.  We had to feelconfident that teleportation did notwarp matter as well as space.    Next slide...\276The next phase of the experiment is totransfer animate matter. We willthoroughly examine all subjects fordeleterious effects.   This is the last slide.\277Termination of Text.
