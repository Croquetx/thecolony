Unpacking directions for Colony.Put all the files in Colony1.sit into a folder labled “CData” (without the quotes).  Put this folder and the application “Colony” on a disk labled “Colony 1”.  Put the file “Zounds” from Colony2.sit on a disk labled “Colony 2”.  Play.  For hard disk use, put “CData” folder, Colony application, and Zounds all in the same folder.  This game may be impossible to play without the decoder which comes with it.  I will try to type it out and upload, but its tortuous typing, and I can’t get to it till next week.  (It’s Aug 13 today).  The game requires that you enter a code to pass through certain doors, etc.  Good luck.  Looked great at MacWorld Expo.  Under multifinder there may not be enough memory for all the sounds.
