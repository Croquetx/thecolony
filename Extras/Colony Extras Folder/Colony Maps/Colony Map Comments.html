<p>These maps include all of the areas in the colony base that I could find.</p>

<p>North is at the top of the maps. A legend for the door markings is found on the first level map. Doors that stand off from the walls go through a space warp to another location. The destinations are not marked on these doors. (I gotta leave some of the work for you!) The entrance to the tunnel to the teleporter labs is off lab two on level 4.</p>

<p>Connections in the 3x3 maze in level 5 are not shown, since the order of the rooms appears to change while you're in the maze. The 5x5 structure there is my theory, but it seemed logical. If you head east in the 3x3 maze, you have a fair chance of exiting the maze. However, one of the rooms in the 3x3 maze has no exits.</p>

<p>Enjoy! -- Pat Gratton</p>
