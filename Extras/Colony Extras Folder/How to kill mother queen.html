<p>Addendum to the Colony Solution:</p>

<p>How to kill the Mother Queen:</p>

<p>There are two tricks that I have found out:</p>

<p>1. Remove the reactor core and bring it back to your ship before you try to kill the queen. It is much easier this way. The queen takes about 60 to 70 hits when the reactor is cold and more than 140 if not.</p>

<p>2. Move very close to the queen. You have to try to get so close that her eyes fill the entire screen. This way she can't see you and you can fire at her at leisure. However, getting this close is a bit tricky and works only one time out of five. This might be a bug you capitalize on.</p>

<p>Have fun,<br />
Christian</p>
