<h1>The Colony Plus Extras Read Me</h1>

<p>This is what you need to know about this package:</p>

<p><b>Colony.dsk</b> - This is game disk image in DiskDup+ format.</p>

<p><b>Colony Extras.dsk</b> - This is the extras disk image in DiskDup+ format. Includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Colony Codes - An Excel worksheet with all the security codes translated into numbers. You need <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/microsoft-excel">Microsoft Excel</a> to view it.</li>

<li>COLoNY Decoder - A HyperCard stack that translates the security code into numbers. Very uselful if you don't have or don't want to install Excel.</li>

<li>Colony Edit 1.0.1 - A saved game editor.</li>

<li>colony help - The game walkthrough.</li>

<li>colony maps - The game levels in pict format. You need MacDraw or a similar program to view them.</li>

<li>How to kill mother queen - The final boss guide.</li>

<li>HyperCard - The application needed to run the COLoNY Decoder.</li>

<li>Zapf Dingbats - The font suitcase needed to view the Colony Codes.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Colony Extras Folder</b> - This folder contains some items from Colony Extras.dsk so you will be able to access them from your host machine without having to quit the game. This is important because the security codes are generated randomly everytime and hence, writing them down for later is useless. The text files have been turned into html files and the pict images have been exported to png format. The only files not included are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Colony Codes and Zapf Dingbats - They have been replaced by Colony Codes.png.</li>

<li>COLoNY Decoder, Colony Edit 1.0.1. and HyperCard - These are Mac OS Classic files that would have been damaged by the zipping process and also by being extracted into a Windows or Linux machine (and in the future, an Intel Mac machine, too, because it won't take long before Apple drops classic compatibility altogether).</li>

</ul>

<p>If your host machine is Classic-friendly, you can extract these files by converting Colony Extras.dsk with <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/shrinkwrap">ShrinkWrap</a>. Here are the instructions: Run ShrinkWrap. Click on the Image menu. Scroll down with the mouse to Convert Image and click on it. Locate the file, select it and press the Choose button. On the next dialog, select either ShrinkWrap 3.x or DiskCopy 6.x as file format and change the extension to .img (if you choose self-mounting, the extension is .sea). Press the Save button, quit ShrinkWrap and mount the new image by double-clicking on it.</p>

<p>For more information, you can always post questions on <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/games/the-colony">The Colony page</a> on Macintosh Garden.</p>
